# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize has given me a brand-new assignment. Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


## Resources
-Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
-Software; Anaconda 4.11.0 , Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6

## Results
The analysis of the ride sharing data shows that:
- The farther you get away from the city the more expensive a ride is and shows you are less likely to find a ride due to the decrese in drivers.
    
 

## Challenge Summary
The main recommendation is to find ways to increase the amount of drivers in the rural cities. The more drivers we can get the more rides that can happen, which can potentially lower the average fare per ride. If that happens more people might be willing to spend on a ride. The number of total rides being larger than the number of total drivers in the Suburban area is a market that can be tapped into. Being able to provide the ride service for people coming into the city for a night out for dinner or sporting event/show can help increase the total fares.
