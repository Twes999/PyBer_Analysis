# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize has given me a brand-new assignment. Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


## Resources
-Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
-Software; Anaconda 4.11.0 , Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6

## Results
The analysis of the ride sharing data shows that:
- The farther you get away from the city the more expensive a ride is and shows you are less likely to find a ride due to the decrese in drivers.
    
 

## Challenge Summary
The changes that were visable in the updated school district analysis were when looking at the district summary and school summary. In each of theis data frames, when looking at the unformatted data you can see the difference in tenths of percents. The reading and math scores in each of these data frames does down by the a few tenths of a percent.
